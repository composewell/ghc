     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     *
     * If the RTS is compiled with profiling enabled StgProfHeader can be used
     * by profiling code to store per-heap object information. Specifically the
     * 'hp_hdr' field is used to store heap profiling information.
     *
     * The generic heap traversal code reserves the least significant bit of the
     * heap profiling word to decide whether we've already visited a given
     * closure in the current pass or not. The rest of the field is free to be
     * used by the calling profiler.
     *
     * By doing things this way we implicitly assume that the LSB is not used by
     * the user. This is true at least for the word aligned pointers which the
     * retainer profiler currently stores there and should be maintained by new
     * users for example by shifting the real data up by one bit.
     *
     * Since we don't want to have to scan the entire heap a second time just to
     * reset the per-object visitied bit before/after the real traversal we make
     * the interpretation of this bit dependent on the value of a global
     * variable, 'flip' and "flip" this variable when we want to invalidate all
     * objects.
     *
     * When the visited bit is equal to the value of 'flip' the closure data is
     * valid otherwise not (see isTravDataValid). Both the value of the closure
     * and global 'flip' value start out as zero, so all closures are considered
     * valid. Before every traversal we invert the value of 'flip' (see
     * traverseInvalidateClosureData) invalidating all closures.
     *
     * There are some complications with this approach, namely: static objects
     * and mutable data. There we do just go over all existing objects to reset
     * the bit manually. See 'resetStaticObjectForProfiling' and
     * 'resetMutableObjects'.
